# 4. Installation
## 4.1. Installation from ZIP archive in TDS format

This is the easiest and recommended way to install the package. The ZIP file `disser-<version>.tds.zip` contains files sorted in a TDS tree, so you can directly unpack this file to directory with your TeX installation.
Example:
```sh
$ cd /path/to/texmf
$ unzip /download/path/disser-<version>.tds.zip
$ mktexlsr
```

## 4.2. Installation from sources

Enter the following commands in the command prompt:
- in a Unix-like environment:
```sh
$ env DESTDIR=/path/to/texmf make install
```
- in Windows command line prompt:
```sh
$ set DESTDIR=disk:\path\to\texmf
$ nomake install
```
Here `/path/to/texmf` and `disk:\path\to\texmf` are paths to your local TeX directory tree. After installation you should update the filename database with the command 
```sh
$ mktexlsr
```
if you install the package to user's directory `"%APPDATA%\MiKTeX\2.9"` or
```sh
$ mktexlsr --admin
```
if you install the package to one of the common directories, like `"%programfiles%\MiKTeX 2.9"` or `"%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\MiKTeX\2.9"`.

Examples of commands for MiKTeX 2.9.

- Installation for all users:
```sh
$ set DESTDIR=%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\MiKTeX\2.9
$ nomake install
$ mktexlsr --admin
```
- Installation for current user only:
```sh
$ set DESTDIR=%APPDATA%\MiKTeX\2.9
